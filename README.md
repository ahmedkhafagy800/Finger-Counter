# Hand Tracking and Finger Counter

## Overview
This project utilizes OpenCV and the **MediaPipe Hands** model to detect a hand in a live camera feed and count the number of extended fingers. MediaPipe provides a robust and efficient solution for real-time hand tracking by detecting and analyzing hand landmarks.
